texttv
======

SVT text-tv (teletext) in the terminal.

Usage
-----

The repository contains two scripts. One (`texttv`) will extract a
single page (or a range of pages) and display it in the terminal. The
other (`browse-texttv`) wraps the first to enable interactive browsing.
It is possible to enter `n` or `p` at the prompt to go to the next or 
previous page.
